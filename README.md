For my Individual Product I decided to create a mobile app for both iOS and Android using Xamarin and built with C#. The reason was I never created an mobile app before and I have a strong interest in displaying large amount of data on a screen which in this case displaying crime coordinates on a map. While the main app is built using C#, I had to learn how to code using XAML which is for the visual appearence of the app.

<h2 align="left">Description</h2>

<h3 align="left">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Displaying crimes on a map with which data such as coordinates which are fetched on boot from the Police UK website using Javascript Object Notation (JSON).</li>
<li>Implement a 'bottom draw' which will allow the user to toggle on/off different types of crimes to be displayed on the map.</li>
<li>Have the app available for both iOS and Android.</li>
<li>Allow the user to search for post codes as well as use the device to get the users' current location using Geolocation.</li>
</ul>

This project was quite an undertaking due to the fact that I would be developing a solution on two different platforms and that in the beginning I had no experience with using Xamarin to develop mobile apps.However, I yearn and welcome a challenge in producing a solution that I hope shows my determination and attention to detail within my final solution. Xamarin is indeed a natural choice as it allows to create a cross-platform app that when developed with the same code can be simulated or run on Android and iOS, however as I found during the development process it isn’t as straight forward as I initially thought with which it involved at times implementing different ways to get a single feature working, while one implementation worked on one platform, there were times when it didn’t work on the other. It took 5 months to build the app from the beginning to the present final state prior to my presentation.
